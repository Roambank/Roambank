## Architecture
### MVVM
Recykloo follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern to maintain a clear separation of concerns and enhance code maintainability and testability.


## Layers and Functions
### Model
The Model layer is responsible for the applicationâ€™s data structure. It defines the core data entities and their relationships.

### View
The View layer is responsible for the UI components and layout. It provides the user interface elements that users interact with.

### ViewModel
The ViewModel layer acts as an intermediary between the Model and View layers. It handles the business logic and state management.

## Commit Message Guidelines
Use the following format for commit messages:
- `feat`: Addition of a new feature
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Changes to documentation
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the code (e.g., formatting, whitespace, punctuation)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Updates to build tasks, package management, etc.
